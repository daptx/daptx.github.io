## Introduction

The original study by Kang et al. (2020) aimed to rapidly measure the spatial accessibility of COVID‐19 healthcare resources (ICU beds & ventilators) in Illinois for both vulnerable populations—defined as people over 50-years old—and actual COVID-19 patients. To execute their analysis, an enhanced two-step floating catchment area (E2FCA) method outlined by Luo and Qi (2009) was used; this looked at the outcome of interactions between demands (i.e. # of potential patients) and supply (i.e. # of beds of physicians). Their findings revealed an uneven distribution of healthcare resources across Illinois, with central and northern Chicago having greater access to these resources than southern Chicago.

In creating a methodology that was computationally efficient, geospatially scalable, and open source, their procedures were documented via a CyberGIS Jupyter Notebook, enabling anyone with access to reproduce of their study. As well, Kang et al (2020) have also maintained an open platform called [WhereCOVID-19](https://wherecovid19.cigi.illinois.edu/spatialAccess.html#7/40.000/-89.000/Dark_Mode-il_acc_i/370) to provide up-to-date information on healthcare availability.

Reproducing Kang et al's (2020) work is critical for verifying the results of their analyses, alongside giving students and other academics a stronger eye for critical investigations of research papers' methodologies. Additionally, by running and making comments/modifications to the original code, suggestions can be made to improve the original methods used. Together, both of these motives can help further the trustability and merit of Kang et al's (2020) paper in informing policymakers and public health practitioners about the allocation of healthcare resources or the distribution of healthcare infrastructure.

## Materials and Methods
briefly explaining and citing what data sources and computational resources were used for the study. The length/depth of this explanation may be similar to your review of the Twitter for Wildfire Hazards paper (Wang et al 2016). Explain any changes you made to the original python notebook / repository.



## Result
include images of findings (maps, graphs) and link to your final repository for the reproduction. Discuss what you learned from the reproduction attempt, especially any knowledge, insight, or uncertainty that was encoded in the repository or discovered in the reproduction but not explained in the published paper.

## Discussion

## Conclusion
with emphasis on the significance of the reproduction study you just completed. Was the study reproducible, and has the reproduction study increased, decreased, or otherwise refined your belief in the validity of the original study? Conclude with any insights, priorities, or questions for future research.

## Acknowledgments

## Notes on Style
 Remember that the primary motivation for reproduction and replication studies is not punitive. Frame your discussions in this report and previous reports in the constructive motivation for improving scientific knowledge through peer review. Project like CyberGISX generally, and the Kang et al 2020 publication specifically, are very new in geography, and our engagement with them should be both encouraging and constructive while emphasizing the value of open science.
