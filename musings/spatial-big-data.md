title: Exploring the Assets and Detriments of Spatial Big Data Research
---

Recently, Xun Shi—Professor of Geography @ Dartmouth College—gave a [presentation](https://aag-geospatialfellows-series.secure-platform.com/a/solicitations/16/sessiongallery/246) about the implementation of a bottom-up approach to epidemic modeling for the [Geospatial Fellows Webinar Series](https://gsi.cigi.illinois.edu/geospatial-fellows-webinar-series/). While the predominate top-down approach in scientific research has been used to establish then apply general models or laws to problems—as a means to simplify representations of the real world and generalize patterns, Shi points out the controlled, simplified, and deterministic properties of this approach don't pair well with complexities geographic problems introduce. With this in mind, Shi's research looked to model COVID-19 at the individual level using a bottom-up approach, where the availability of big data of individuals' mobility and high-performance computing capabilities encouraged a meaningful assessment of how COVID-19 spread within a specific city of China. Based on simple rules, the bottom-up approach allowed for the modeling of local spaces and individuals, their interaction, stochastic/randomly determined processes, and feedbacks—all of which helped create understanding of the geographic complexities tied to COVID-19's spreading that classical SIR models (top-down approach) fail to capture.

Within Shi's research, however, there's an important conversation to have about the assets and detriments of using big data within spatial research. In sourcing data, Shi notes how a fellow colleague of his worked closely with the Chinese CDC and other local governmental agencies to retrieve human mobility data (both individual and aggregated). The aggregated data—sourced from China Unicom, a telecommunications company—revealed the movements of individual clusters from one spatial unit to another during a given time. While the individual data provided this information as well on a person to person basis, there was gaps and missing data that made the aggregated data more effective and reliable to use*0*

Even though China's government has established a regime of mass surveillance throughout the country, the use of this seemingly personal data by researchers and other parties opens up a dialogue about the ethics and responsibilities associated with using big data.

Please summarize your thoughts in a blog post in preparation for debates on May 14. See the May 14 page for guidance on blog post content.

In the debates, some of you will focus on Xun Shi’s talk, and some on Mei-Po Kwan’s. Some of you will introduce the content of the talk from a neutral point of view and then moderate the debate. Some of you will debate in favor of expansion of capabilities and applications for spatial big data research. Others will debate in favor of curtailing and limiting spatial big data research. In your arguments, be sure to raise theoretically-informed arguments about ethics and reproducibility.
