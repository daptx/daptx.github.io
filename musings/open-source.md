title: What is Open Source GIScience?
---


At its core, Open Source GIScience lies on the foundation of being able to create, distribute, and apply new software and its tangible code for the general public (Rey, 2009). Honing into the concept of open source, while used interchangeably with free software by both scholars and practitioners, these movements are slightly distinguished by their language and philosophical principles. On the language front, the term *free* often connotated ideas of inferiority (esp. in the corporate world), which served as the basis for a call to action to shift to *open source*, a more market-friendly term. Looking to philosophical grounds, free software is grounded in morality, whereas is open source looks to the practical benefits of its license. Elaborating, free software emphasizes the availability of the source code for the user to actively use and innovate upon, spotlighting the general ‘freedoms’ of this software type outlined by the Free Software Foundation (FSF) (Rey, 2009). Lastly, using the common square-rectangle analogy, while free software can always be open-source, not all open source can be free software. 

Furthering the narrative on open source, two references from Rey’s “Show me the code: spatial analysis and open source” that contributed to my understanding of open source were the bazaar model of development and the gift economy. Focusing on the developing environment rather than the availability of code, the bazaar model entails a more “evolutionary and distributed” (Rey, 2009) format—signifying the more collaborative and opportunistic realm for open source developers. Additionally, the gift economy was another critical ‘aha’ moment in defining open source. Whereas autonomy in traditional economics revolves around the idea of how much you own (i.e. the infamous quote “I own 51% of this company”), power in open source is derived from one’s contributions to and for the community. Although the ‘science’ portion is incorporated still isn’t clear-cut to me, I believe the grounds for GIScience stems from its use for critical spatial analysis within academia, and frameworks for which it should be practiced: data availability within the public domain, open code software, etc (Singleton, 2019).
