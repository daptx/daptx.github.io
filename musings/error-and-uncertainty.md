title: Error and Uncertainty in GIS

*DRAFT: This post will be updated in the coming days*

A common misconception the general public often has about cartographic layouts, visualizations of space, and geographic research are that they represent reality. However, as asserted by Longley et. al, "it is impossible to make a perfect representation of the world, so uncertainty about it is inevitable" (128). As geographers, we must acknowledge our representations of space will always re-present (distort) reality, rather than embrace it. Hence, Chapter 6 of Longley et al. (2008) dives into and discusses the principal sources of uncertainty as you move from the 'real world' to 'analysis,' as seen in *figure 6.1*

Each intermediary step (labeled as U1, U2, U3) represents *filter* where distortion of data or error can occur, which can impact the way the real world is conceived, measured and represented, and analyzed. Reflecting on my first-hand experiences with uncertainty, in [GEOG 0126](https://catalog.middlebury.edu/courses/view/catalog/catalog%2FMCUG/course/course%2FGEOG1026), we worked with raster layers denoting land cover, during our sustainable development unit. As noted in the chapter, "errors in land cover maps can occur in locations of boundaries of areas, as well as in classification of areas" (139). While I had never thought to check these land cover classifications provided to us, this would've helped omit any mislocated boundaries and misallocated classes I may have produced in my final cartographic layout. Likewise, the use of self-chosen boundaries and symbology presented a degree of vagueness in my maps, where I had to consider both the cartographic and cognitive implications this had on the work I was producing.  

I believe as geographers, one of key responsibilities we should be held accountable for with regards to uncertainty in research is transparency and acknowledging these errors are to be expected in GIS. Whether that's bringing attention to these uncertainties in documentation or explicitly stating ones intentions behind depicting some spatial feature in a re-presentive light, geographers are capable of fulfilling these responsibilities in an ethical and well-intentioned manner.
