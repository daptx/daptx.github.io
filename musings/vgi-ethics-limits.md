title: Ethics & Limits of Volunteered Geographic Information - Critiquing Humanitarian GIS
---

Crawford & Finn (2014) delve into the challenges that arise from the use of social and mobile data, inspecting the ontological and epistemological limitations, alongside ethical challenges (primarily consent concerns) of using crowd-sourced/volunteered geographic information (VGI) in understanding natural disasters. When using VGI to inspect these humanitarian crises, temporal distortion on social media often creates an 'emergency imaginary,' which pigeonholes the definition of a disaster used in research to an event that's is both bounded within space and time. This commonly used view of disasters has thus led to uncertainty in the value of Twitter in actually representing people's experiences during a humanitarian crisis. The use of hashtags, direct messaging activity, and performative activism/empathy as a result only capture the unpredictable and short-term nature of these disasters, NOT the longterm developments after the event: coping mechanisms and recovery.
