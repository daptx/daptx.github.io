title: Ethics & Limits of Volunteered Geographic Information - Critiquing Humanitarian GIS
---

Crawford & Finn (2014) delve into the challenges that arise from the use of social and mobile data, inspecting the ontological and epistemological limitations, alongside ethical challenges (primarily consent concerns) of using crowd-sourced/volunteered geographic information (VGI) in understanding natural disasters. When using VGI to inspect these humanitarian crises, temporal distortion on social media often creates an 'emergency imaginary,' which pigeonholes the definition of a disaster used in research to an event that's is both bounded within space and time. This commonly used view of disasters has thus led to uncertainty in the value of Twitter in actually representing people's experiences during a Humanitarian cries. The use of hashtags, direct messaging activity, and performative activism/empathy as a result only captures the  unpredictable and short-term nature of these disasters, NOT the longterm developments after the event: coping mechanisms and recovery.

What types of uncertainty are most prevalant in the use of VGI for research on disasters and humanitarian crises?
Do you think that there is any ethical obligation in relation to uncertainty?
Or, do you think that there are ethical concerns in using VGI that complicate uncertainty?
