title: GIS: Tool, Toolmaking, or Science?
---

When we are "doing GIS," what meanings are attached to this phrase of action? This postulation ventures into the debate of how GIS (Geographic Information Systems) should be categorized/viewed today. From the perspective of Wright et al, the 3 primary positions discussants have taken on the matter are that a. GIS is a tool, b. GIS is for toolmaking, and c. GIS is a science.



Which category of “GIS as Science” most applies to the work you have done so far in this course or other courses using GIS? Do those forms of GIS count as “science”?
How can open source GIS contribute to solving problems of the reproducibility crisis?
