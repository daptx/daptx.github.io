title: GIS - Tool, Toolmaking, or Science?
---

When we are "doing GIS," what meanings are attached to this phrase of action? This postulation ventures into the debate of how GIS (Geographic Information Systems) should be categorized/viewed today. From the perspective of Wright et al, the 3 primary positions discussants have taken on the matter are of a. GIS as a tool, b. GIS as toolmaking, & c. GIS as a science.

Proponents of GIS as a tool view this 'system' as a means to advance a particular purpose. Similar to other applications like Stata or Tableau, GIS utilizes a series of associated techniques to answer spatial inquiries and further the knowledge base of its integral disciplines (Geography, Urban Studies, so on so forth). Both inherently neutral and application driven, GIS as a tool spotlights direct problem solving, but not so much innovating——which requires a more inward point of view (i.e. GIS development).

Contrasting this outlook, GIS as a science aligns more with innovation, or what Wright et al. would call 'doing science,' over application. A core principle of scientific inquiry is   ()

Considering the challenges of GIS discussed in class: automating a concept, experimenting w/ parameters, replicating in a new context, and critiquing/improving upon previous iterations of work


No definitive right or wrong


Which category of “GIS as Science” most applies to the work you have done so far in this course or other courses using GIS? Do those forms of GIS count as “science”?
How can open source GIS contribute to solving problems of the reproducibility crisis?
