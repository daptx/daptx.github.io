## About Me

I'm a senior at Middlebury College studying Environmental Studies & Geography, with a keen interest in GIS, cartography, & editorial graphics. On campus, I row for the [Middlebury Men's Crew Team](https://middcrew.org/), am the Editor in Chief of [Middlebury Geographic](https://issuu.com/middgeog/)â€”our college's outdoors publication, serve on the [Environmental Studies Student Advisory Committee (ES-SAC)](http://www.middlebury.edu/academics/es/es-student-advisory-council), and give tours for the Admissions Office. Other interests of mine include sustainable fashion, cooking Asian street food, and watching A24 films. You can find my <a href="Resume[2022].pdf" target="_blank">one-page resume here</a>.
