title: Urban Resilience Analysis - Green Accessibility in Dar es Salaam
---

## Guiding Question

*What percentage of residences in each of Dar es Salam's administrative wards are with 0.25 kilometers (a 3-minute walk) of a public greenspace?*

In this analysis, we used SQL queries in PostGIS to answer this simple spatial question pertaining to urban resilience & environmental justice in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. This analysis was done in collaboration with [Emma Clinton](https://emmaclinton.github.io/), GIS aficionado and Conservation Biology student at Middlebury College.

## Accessing Data

The greenspace and residential data used in this analysis were derived from [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=10/-6.8767/39.2287), a collaborative mapping effort aimed at sourcing geodata from the public (relating to the concept of [open source](https://opensource.org/osd)). Data collected for OSM comes from various parties (individuals, research groups, organizations, etc.), where information around the collection is built into the data via a unique identifier and timestamp. For users of OSM, this resource can be helpful for identifying who collected data and when that data was collected for a given space, providing background context that may allude to benefits and gaps within the open source data. In our case, a large portion of contributors to our used dataset were members of [Ramani Huria](https://ramanihuria.org/en/), a community-based mapping project concerned about flood resilience and development in Dar es Salaam. The OSM data downloaded and pushed into our PostGIS database for this analysis was provided by Joseph Holler, Assistant Professor of Geography at Middlebury College.


[Administrative wards data](https://geonode.resilienceacademy.ac.tz/layers/geonode_data:geonode:dar_es_salaam_administrative_wards) was downloaded from the [Resilience Academy](https://geonode.resilienceacademy.ac.tz/), a digital geospatial data repository with WMS raster and WFS feature services that supports research, education, and disaster-risk management practices. Note: The Resilience Academy is one of several projects created by Ramani Huria.   

## Methods

*All sql queries used for this analysis can be found [here](assets/x) for replication*

objectives:
- create a layer of points that are residential buildings in Dar es Salaam
- determine how many residences are contained within each ward
- pick out greenspaces and buffer them by our 0.25km distance of accessibility
- determine how many residences in each ward fall within the greenspace buffers.
