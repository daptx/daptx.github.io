title: Urban Resilience Analysis - Green Accessibility in Dar es Salaam
---

## Guiding Question

*What percentage of residences in each of Dar es Salam's administrative wards are with 0.25 kilometers (a 3-minute walk) of a public greenspace?*

In this analysis, we used SQL queries in PostGIS to answer this simple spatial question pertaining to urban resilience & environmental justice in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. This analysis was done in collaboration with [Emma Clinton](https://emmaclinton.github.io/), GIS aficionado and Biology student at Middlebury College.
